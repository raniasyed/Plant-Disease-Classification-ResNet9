# Plant-Disease-Classification-ResNet9
Plant disease detection plays a crucial role in ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for plant disease classification using the ResNet9 architecture, a variant of the Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Leveraging a subset of the PlantVillage dataset comprising 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves across 38 different classes, encompassing 14 plant species. The proposed approach involves directly processing of RGB images for disease classification. By employing advanced techniques such as learning rate scheduling, weight decay, and gradient clipping, we achieve an average accuracy of 99.2\% on the dataset, surpassing existing models such as Densenet-121. Our study showcases the potential of deep learning architectures in revolutionizing plant disease management and contributing to global agricultural sustainability.
